        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        This is the standard/abstract interface method that all RestClient&#39;s support.

        The idea behind this method is to figure out how to route this query in the most
        efficient manner we can do it in. If you want to guarantee a specific type of query
        you can use `DynClient.query`, etc.

        Generally, this is the best, generally method to use since it can adapt your request
        to the most efficient way to query Dynamo. The `DynApi` will use this method generally
        when it&#39;s asked to get something (for example, when using `DynApi.get_via_id`).

        For more info on how you can query, see:

        - [Advanced Queries](#advanced-queries)
            - [Examples](#examples_1)

        Here is the general process this method goes though to determine how to query dynamo
        for a given query:

        1. If provided query is empty.
              - Will paginate though all items in table efficiently; multiple items
                will be returned per-request in parallel.
                You&#39;ll get back a generator that gives you an object at time, but behind
                the scenes we are getting a page at a time from dynamo.
        2. We will try to batch it en-mass in parallel if we can.
           We can do this if one of the following is true:
              - Query only contains &#39;id&#39; key; this is because an &#39;id&#39; should have full primary key;
                meaning it will contain both hash and range key (if needed).
                You can provide a list of strings or `DynKey` objects.
                   - See `DynModel.id` for more details on how to use `str` with an &#39;id&#39;.
                   - See `DynKey` for more details on what a composite primary-key as a `str` is
                     like.
              - Table only has a hash-key (no range/sort key) and you provide nothing but
                hash-keys (ie: no other attributes in query)
        3. Next, we see if we can use a Dynamo query via `DynClient.query`.
              - In the future, this will automatically querying a Secondary Index if one is
                available.
                (Not Implemented Yet, we will add this when needed)
        4. Next, fallback to using a Global Index if one is available.
              - (Not Implemented Yet, we will do it when we need it)
        5. If that&#39;s not possible, in the future we fallback to scan operation.
            - (Not Implemented Yet; This isn&#39;t implemented currently and will raise NotImplemented.
              Scan operations can be very slow and so it&#39;s not something we really want to do
              normally... I did implement this if getting everything, but with filters/attributes
              to query on I decided to wait until we need it before implementing this currently).

        .. todo:: Implement querying via Secondary/Global indexes; Scanning with query values.
            see above for details.



        Args:
            query: Dict keys are the attribute/key names and values are what
                to filter on for that name.  Operators after double `__` work just like you
                would expect for our xyngular API&#39;s... here is an example:

                ```python
                { &#34;some_attr_name__gte&#34;: 2 }
                ```

                In this case, we look for `some_attr_name` greater than or equal to integer `2`.

                You MUST provide at least one value for the hash key of the table for right now.
                In the future, we will support doing a table-scan to support queries without
                a hash-key. But for right now it&#39;s required.

                For more information with examples see [Advanced Queries](#advanced-queries).

            fields: This is supposed to only retrieve provided field names in returned objects;
                currently not implemented.
            **dynamo_params: Extra parameters to include on the Dynamo request(s) that are
                generated. This is 100% optional.

        # todo: We want basic logic in here to decide on batch_get vs query
        #       vs [eventually] dyn_scan.
        #       We sort of implement basic logic here to determin
        #       the best way to query dynamo so we have that logic mostly centralized instead
        #       of scattered everywhere. The logic is cetnered around how we will mostly be using
        #       dynamo. The times where we have exceptions, the outside world can just directly
        #       call `dyn_scan/query` them selves and customize the dynamo call more.

        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        Forces `DynClient` to use a query. If you want a way for client to automatically
        figure out the best way to execute your query, use one of these instead:

        - `DynApi.get`
        - `DynClient.get`

        For more info see:

        - [Advanced Queries](#advanced-queries)
            - [Examples](#examples_1)

        For a quick summary on how to provide query,
        see &#39;query&#39; argument doc (just a few lines down).
        But I would highly recommend looking at [Advanced Queries](#advanced-queries) for
        more details with examples!

        Args:
            api (DynApi): BaseApi object to use, this is how we know the table name, model class,
                etc.
            query (Query): You can give a simple dict here, modeled after how the standard rest-api
                query dict&#39;s work. Dict keys are the attribute/key names and values are what
                to filter on for that name.  Operators after double `__` work just like you
                would expect for our xyngular API&#39;s... here is an example:

                ```python
                { &#34;some_attr_name__gte&#34;: 2 }
                ```

                In this case, we look for `some_attr_name` greater than or equal to integer `2`.

                You MUST provide at least one value for the hash key of the table when using
                `query` or boto3/dynamo will raise an exception.

                This is an easy way to fill out `KeyConditionExpression` and/or `FilterExpression`.
                This method can figure out which attribute goes with which one and construct
                both expressions as needed.

                For more information with examples see [Advanced Queries](#advanced-queries).

            **params (DynParams): You can provide other standard boto3 query parameters here as you
                need. If you provide both dynamo_params and query, the ones in query will overwrite
                ones in dynamo_params if there is a conflict;

                The `query` param could use either a `KeyConditionExpression` or `FilterExpression`
                depending on what attributes are in the query dict.

        Yields:
            DynModel[M]: The next object we got from dynamo. This method returns a generator
                that will eventually go though all the results from dynamo in a memory-efficient
                manner.

        This is mainly here to create table when mocking aws for unit tests. If the table
        really does not exist in reality, this also can create it.

        Time To Live Notes:

        We can&#39;t enable TimeToLive during table creation, we have to wait until after it&#39;s
        created. This is a minor issue, since the table will still function correctly,
        the queries will still filter out expired items like normal.  The only difference
        is we could get charged extra for storage we are not using. We need to still filter
        items out of our queries because deletion does not happen immediately [could take up
        to 48 hours].

        At this point, it&#39;s expected that you&#39;ll have to go into the AWS dynamo console
        to setup automatic TimeToLive item deletion for a table if you want this to create it for
        you.

        In reality, serverless framework is expected to setup the real tables for services that
        are running directly in aws; and that&#39;s where you should setup the TTL stuff for real
        tables.

        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        This is the standard/abstract interface method that all RestClient&#39;s support.

        The idea behind this method is to figure out how to route this query in the most
        efficient manner we can do it in. If you want to guarantee a specific type of query
        you can use `DynClient.query`, etc.

        Generally, this is the best, generally method to use since it can adapt your request
        to the most efficient way to query Dynamo. The `DynApi` will use this method generally
        when it&#39;s asked to get something (for example, when using `DynApi.get_via_id`).

        For more info on how you can query, see:

        - [Advanced Queries](#advanced-queries)
            - [Examples](#examples_1)

        Here is the general process this method goes though to determine how to query dynamo
        for a given query:

        1. If provided query is empty.
              - Will paginate though all items in table efficiently; multiple items
                will be returned per-request in parallel.
                You&#39;ll get back a generator that gives you an object at time, but behind
                the scenes we are getting a page at a time from dynamo.
        2. We will try to batch it en-mass in parallel if we can.
           We can do this if one of the following is true:
              - Query only contains &#39;id&#39; key; this is because an &#39;id&#39; should have full primary key;
                meaning it will contain both hash and range key (if needed).
                You can provide a list of strings or `DynKey` objects.
                   - See `DynModel.id` for more details on how to use `str` with an &#39;id&#39;.
                   - See `DynKey` for more details on what a composite primary-key as a `str` is
                     like.
              - Table only has a hash-key (no range/sort key) and you provide nothing but
                hash-keys (ie: no other attributes in query)
        3. Next, we see if we can use a Dynamo query via `DynClient.query`.
              - In the future, this will automatically querying a Secondary Index if one is
                available.
                (Not Implemented Yet, we will add this when needed)
        4. Next, fallback to using a Global Index if one is available.
              - (Not Implemented Yet, we will do it when we need it)
        5. If that&#39;s not possible, in the future we fallback to scan operation.
            - (Not Implemented Yet; This isn&#39;t implemented currently and will raise NotImplemented.
              Scan operations can be very slow and so it&#39;s not something we really want to do
              normally... I did implement this if getting everything, but with filters/attributes
              to query on I decided to wait until we need it before implementing this currently).

        .. todo:: Implement querying via Secondary/Global indexes; Scanning with query values.
            see above for details.



        Args:
            query: Dict keys are the attribute/key names and values are what
                to filter on for that name.  Operators after double `__` work just like you
                would expect for our xyngular API&#39;s... here is an example:

                ```python
                { &#34;some_attr_name__gte&#34;: 2 }
                ```

                In this case, we look for `some_attr_name` greater than or equal to integer `2`.

                You MUST provide at least one value for the hash key of the table for right now.
                In the future, we will support doing a table-scan to support queries without
                a hash-key. But for right now it&#39;s required.

                For more information with examples see [Advanced Queries](#advanced-queries).

        Forces `DynClient` to use a query. If you want a way for client to automatically
        figure out the best way to execute your query, use one of these instead:

        - `DynApi.get`
        - `DynClient.get`

        For more info see:

        - [Advanced Queries](#advanced-queries)
            - [Examples](#examples_1)

        For a quick summary on how to provide query,
        see &#39;query&#39; argument doc (just a few lines down).
        But I would highly recommend looking at [Advanced Queries](#advanced-queries) for
        more details with examples!

        Args:
            api (DynApi): BaseApi object to use, this is how we know the table name, model class,
                etc.
            query (Query): You can give a simple dict here, modeled after how the standard rest-api
                query dict&#39;s work. Dict keys are the attribute/key names and values are what
                to filter on for that name.  Operators after double `__` work just like you
                would expect for our xyngular API&#39;s... here is an example:

                ```python
                { &#34;some_attr_name__gte&#34;: 2 }
                ```

                In this case, we look for `some_attr_name` greater than or equal to integer `2`.

                You MUST provide at least one value for the hash key of the table when using
                `query` or boto3/dynamo will raise an exception.

                This is an easy way to fill out `KeyConditionExpression` and/or `FilterExpression`.
                This method can figure out which attribute goes with which one and construct
                both expressions as needed.

                For more information with examples see [Advanced Queries](#advanced-queries).

            **params (DynParams): You can provide other standard boto3 query parameters here as you
                need. If you provide both dynamo_params and query, the ones in query will overwrite
                ones in dynamo_params if there is a conflict;

                The `query` param could use either a `KeyConditionExpression` or `FilterExpression`
                depending on what attributes are in the query dict.

        Yields:
            DynModel[M]: The next object we got from dynamo. This method returns a generator
                that will eventually go though all the results from dynamo in a memory-efficient
                manner.
        &#34;&#34;&#34;

        # 2. Look at hash/range keys and try to match them up if they are lists into DynKey&#39;s
        # 3. Considering auto-finding out if we have a list of keys and can just do batch-get

        We can&#39;t enable TimeToLive during table creation, we have to wait until after it&#39;s
        created. This is a minor issue, since the table will still function correctly,
        the queries will still filter out expired items like normal.  The only difference
        is we could get charged extra for storage we are not using. We need to still filter
        items out of our queries because deletion does not happen immediately [could take up
        to 48 hours].

        At this point, it&#39;s expected that you&#39;ll have to go into the AWS dynamo console
        to setup automatic TimeToLive item deletion for a table if you want this to create it for
        you.

        In reality, serverless framework is expected to setup the real tables for services that
        are running directly in aws; and that&#39;s where you should setup the TTL stuff for real
        tables.

       We can do this if one of the following is true:
          - Query only contains &#39;id&#39; key; this is because an &#39;id&#39; should have full primary key;
            meaning it will contain both hash and range key (if needed).
            You can provide a list of strings or `DynKey` objects.
               - See `DynModel.id` for more details on how to use `str` with an &#39;id&#39;.
               - See `DynKey` for more details on what a composite primary-key as a `str` is
                 like.
          - Table only has a hash-key (no range/sort key) and you provide nothing but
            hash-keys (ie: no other attributes in query)
    3. Next, we see if we can use a Dynamo query via `DynClient.query`.
          - In the future, this will automatically querying a Secondary Index if one is
            available.
            (Not Implemented Yet, we will add this when needed)
    4. Next, fallback to using a Global Index if one is available.
          - (Not Implemented Yet, we will do it when we need it)
    5. If that&#39;s not possible, in the future we fallback to scan operation.
        - (Not Implemented Yet; This isn&#39;t implemented currently and will raise NotImplemented.
          Scan operations can be very slow and so it&#39;s not something we really want to do
          normally... I did implement this if getting everything, but with filters/attributes
          to query on I decided to wait until we need it before implementing this currently).

    .. todo:: Implement querying via Secondary/Global indexes; Scanning with query values.
        see above for details.



    Args:
        query: Dict keys are the attribute/key names and values are what
            to filter on for that name.  Operators after double `__` work just like you
            would expect for our xyngular API&#39;s... here is an example:

            ```python
            { &#34;some_attr_name__gte&#34;: 2 }
            ```

            In this case, we look for `some_attr_name` greater than or equal to integer `2`.

            You MUST provide at least one value for the hash key of the table for right now.
            In the future, we will support doing a table-scan to support queries without
            a hash-key. But for right now it&#39;s required.

    #       vs [eventually] dyn_scan.

    #       the best way to query dynamo so we have that logic mostly centralized instead
    #       of scattered everywhere. The logic is cetnered around how we will mostly be using
    #       dynamo. The times where we have exceptions, the outside world can just directly
    #       call `dyn_scan/query` them selves and customize the dynamo call more.
    #       `get` is the thing that figured out the best to this to in the general
    #       case.

    #       2. Have id/hash + other attributes
    #           A. More than one hash
    #               I. Use several query calls.
    #           B. Only one hash
    #               I. Use single query call.
    #       3. Have no hash key, just other attributes.
    #           A. Must use `scan`.
